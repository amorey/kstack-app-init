// reset would wrongly clear last-known data on every failed retry.
// See docs/adr/2026-08-09-transport-status-generation.md

// An `error` frame is transport-level only (GraphQL errors arrive inside
// `next`); it reconnects rather than `sink.error` — such failures are almost
// always transient and a terminal error would kill the recovery path. Reporting
// split: `closed`/`error` report to the error bus; `complete` (graceful, can be
// legitimate — sidecar shutdown, chat's finite stream) reconnects silently.
