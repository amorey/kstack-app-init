// The JSONPath subset a CRD's printer columns are read with, over an object's native body.
//
// **Deliberately not a JSONPath library.** Kubernetes validates a printer column's path by
// parsing it with the full jsonpath parser, so a filter (`[?(@.type=="Ready")]`) or a wildcard is
// a legal CRD — this reader does not evaluate those, and answers undefined so the cell renders
// empty. Closing that gap means a general JSONPath dependency evaluating cluster-authored
// expressions over untrusted bodies, for columns almost nobody writes.

// SEGMENT matches one step, anchored so anything it cannot describe ends the walk:
// `.name`, `[0]`, `['quoted key']`, `["quoted key"]`.
const SEGMENT = /^(?:\.([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)|\[(\d+)\]|\['([^']*)'\]|\["([^"]*)"\])/;

// readPath resolves path against body, or undefined for a path that names nothing, uses a form
// this does not support, or runs off a non-object. It never throws: the body is `unknown` off the
// wire and may be partial, and a column is not worth a broken row.
export function readPath(body: unknown, path: string): unknown {
  // A leading dot is required of every printer column, so its absence is a path for someone
  // else's evaluator.
  if (!path.startsWith('.')) return undefined;
