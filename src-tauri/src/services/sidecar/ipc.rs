//! Host↔sidecar IPC endpoint. Two responsibilities:
//!   1. **Addressing.** [`Endpoint::pick`] — a per-instance UDS path (Unix) or
//!      `\\.\pipe\` name (Windows), picked *before* spawn and passed via
//!      `--socket`, so the sidecar never negotiates where to listen. Pure,
//!      I/O-free value.
//!   2. **Dialing.** [`Target::connect`] / [`Target::connect_with_budget`] —
//!      capped-backoff retry, returning a [`Stream`] hyper consumes identically
//!      on both platforms, and only after the peer answering it proves to be
//!      the sidecar we spawned.
//!
//! "ipc", not "socket" — the latter would exclude Windows named pipes.
