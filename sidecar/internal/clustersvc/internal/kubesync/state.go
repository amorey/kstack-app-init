// KindState is one kind's standing answer — a live stream's, where DiscoveryState is a
// set of passes, and the difference decides every field here. It carries no identity: the
// caller named the kind to read it.
//
// **Nothing stores it.** It is assembled at read from the three things that own its parts: the
// reason the worker committed, the supervisor's own pacing, and the session's stamps. A stored
// copy would be a stale duplicate of all three.
//
// The worker's value is the REASON alone. Everything else a live stream stands behind is already
// the supervisor's — when the reason last moved is when it last committed, and the pacing is its
// Attempts — so a value carrying them would be a second copy to keep in step.
//
// **It carries no Observation, where DiscoveryState carries three**, and the rule behind that is
// what makes each shape right. A sweep is three independent reads, each separately interesting,
// and each one's Attempts means exactly what it says — so handing them over is the answer. One
// worker's record is only correct through this seam's gates: its last exit describes the kind
// while it is DOWN and is the failure it recovered from once it is up again, and its next attempt
// is the schedule a running stream was dispatched on rather than a retry. Those are the two facts
// a reader is likeliest to get wrong, so they are folded here rather than published raw.
//
// A pass is judged by its last attempt. A stream is judged by whether it is established
// now and has recently proven itself alive, which is a different question and needs
// different evidence:
//
//   - **Silence is ambiguous.** A watch sending nothing is either a quiet collection or a
//     wedged connection. LastLiveAt is what separates them — a delta OR a bookmark, since
//     bookmarks exist to make an idle watch prove itself — and Stale is what it reads as
//     once that proof ages past the threshold.
//   - **A healthy stream has no next attempt.** NextRetryAt is set only while a run is
//     down, where a pass always has one scheduled.
//   - **Flapping hides at an instant.** A watch that reconnects every thirty seconds reads
//     Watching whenever it is read; Restarts is the only field that says otherwise.
