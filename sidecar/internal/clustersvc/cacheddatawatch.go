// The shared loop behind every cached-data watch (kinds, objects, events). One loop for
// all three, because the bookmark discipline and the diff are protocol rules rather than
// per-watch choices.
//
// The mechanism, end to end — there is no polling anywhere in it:
//
//  1. Claim the cache's store (never creating its file) and subscribe to the store's
//     change bus BEFORE reading, so a write landing between the two costs one redundant
//     re-read instead of a lost frame.
//  2. Send the snapshot: every row as Added, then one Bookmark. A cache with no file yet
//     is empty, not pending — the Bookmark still goes out, and the watch then waits for
//     the manager to announce the file's creation.
//  3. Wait for change notifications. Every committed write pings the bus (a bare
//     coalesced signal, no payload); the loop collapses a burst of pings into one
//     re-read of the full collection and diffs it by key against the previous read.
//     A new key is Added, a changed row Modified, and a key that disappeared is Deleted
//     — carrying its last-known row, since it is gone from the store and the client
//     keys the removal by id.
//  4. The store closing (a clear, a teardown, shutdown) ends the watch cleanly; the
//     client reconnects and re-snapshots against whatever replaced it.
