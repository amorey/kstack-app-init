// Package model holds the gqlgen-generated GraphQL models (models_gen.go).
//
// This hand-written file exists ONLY to keep the package non-empty: gqlgen rewrites
// models_gen.go on every run, and a package with no Go files can't be loaded for
// autobinding. Types bind directly to the cluster types (see gqlgen.yml), so there are no
// hand-written models.
