//
// It takes two halves because a resolver and the frames it feeds never share a
// response context, and gqlgen builds each subscription frame as data alone: by the
// time the reason exists there is no frame left to attach it to. InterceptOperation
// hangs the slot on the operation ctx — which gqlgen threads into both the resolvers
// and every later frame — and InterceptResponse claims it once the stream is spent,
// emitting one final errors-only response ahead of the transport's completion.
